This app is my first trial ot crate a simple app to run on Apple Watch OS.
It has target and timer and plays haptics when the target is reached within the given time or failed.
In case of win celebration animations are also previewed.
After each win or loss game restartes.

Game has no encription, no registration, does not use local network, internet, or bluetoot, does not use location, and does not make any api calls.

Perfect to install on a kid's watch.
